No So Simple
============

Basic Chrome extension to search out and highlight the word _simply_ within documents. Emphasizing the "simply rule", that if a tutorial contains the word simply, it was probably not designed for beginners.

Available for download from the Chrome Webstore [Not So Simple](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/not-so-simple/ajlkhboagakfehbjcdbaepgbhglkoipn)

Huge Thanks
-----------

I owe all the real functionality to [@padolsey](https://github.com/padolsey) for the awesome [findAndReplaceDOMText](https://github.com/padolsey/findAndReplaceDOMText) source code. Also big thanks to [@quincylarson](https://github.com/quincylarson) for handing me the oportunity to write my first Chrome extension.
